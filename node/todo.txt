I only see the first five lines in my chart, what gives?

The colors for the first five lines, areas and legends are defined in the stylesheet for the light and dark themes. For a sixth line, you would add the follow CSS rules:

.mg-line6-color {
    stroke: steelblue;
}

.mg-area6-color {
    fill: steelblue;
}

.mg-hover-line6-color {
    fill: steelblue;
}

.mg-line6-legend-color {
    color: steelblue;
}
